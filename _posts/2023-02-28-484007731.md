**Inverse relationship between ease of access and quality of advice**: there’s no provable law here, but it’s generally my experience that the people with the best advice and relevant experience are too busy doing things to be consistently hanging out in large communities. There are exceptions here–and if you hang out frequently in a public community, then I’m sure you’re one of them–but I am deeply skeptical that you get the best advice on complex issues by asking in large forums
