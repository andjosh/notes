It’s seems obvious that collective action from internet creators is the new frontier. As platforms like Facebook and Twitter race to give users more tools to monetize their content, creators are beginning to see themselves as a collective labor force and are beginning to experiment with how to fight for better wages or safer working conditions. Black American Tiktok users went on strike in June, refusing to make a new dance challenge for Megan Thee Stallion’s song “Thot Shit,” and accused the platform’s biggest white influencers of co-opting and appropriating their dances. (If you’re curious, I did an interview for my paying subscribers about how copyright works for viral dances.)
