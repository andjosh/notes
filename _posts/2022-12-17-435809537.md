Sidechain compression listens to a second track to decide when to bring the input track volume down. The most common use is to use the kick drum track as the second trigger track. This means when the kick hits, your sidechained track momentarily comes down in volume. This means the kick has fewer sounds to compete with, which makes it sound clearer in the mix.
