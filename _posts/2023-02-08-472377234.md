In [game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory), a **focal point** (or **Schelling point**) is a solution that people tend to choose by default in the absence of communication. The concept was introduced by the American economist [Thomas Schelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Schelling) in his book *The Strategy of Conflict* (1960).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_point_(game_theory)#cite_note-isbn0-674-84031-3-1) Schelling states that "(p)eople *can* often concert their intentions or expectations with others if each knows that the other is trying to do the same" in a cooperative situation (at page 57), so their action would converge on a focal point which has some kind of prominence compared with the environment.
