lol c’mon, if this wasn’t from an A.I., this would just be one of those lame image sets you’d see on StumbleUpon in 2011. But because an A.I. made it, suddenly users started to think there was some kind of authority to it.

And alongside this growing sense that an A.I. could somehow create or describe something that a human being might not be capable of perceiving has come the inevitable existential panic about what its politics are.
