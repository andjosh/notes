I recommend sharing the full document with the group, then spending time with those who have the most feedback. You often won’t get much feedback at this stage, which is fine, you are now moving into socializing the plan rather than simply crafting it.

Be aware that once you share the document with the full set of stakeholders, it will almost inevitably leak out to the wider company. Companies are design to spread context, not to conceal it, and you just can’t fight that tendency. Instead, make sure to edit out anything too sensitive to share widely, particularly changes that directly impact individuals or teams
