I think my favorite activity ever is cooking for people in my own home and being able to be in that flow state and feel comfortable and feel safe and I haven't been able to do that in my life until recently. Restaurants arenâ€™t a place where your nervous system is aligned and you feel safe getting in touch with yourself. Restaurants are not a spiritual place despite what a lot of chefs want to think or project.
