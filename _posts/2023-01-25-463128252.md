Related, if you can see a better way to do it, strongly consider *keeping your mouth shut* if that way is only 5% better. If you improve the project by a few percent and sap your report's motivation and confidence by 50%, you're probably not making things better for your company. Save your insights for times where you think your way is 50+% better.

In short, if you are overwhelmed, make sure you're doing your executive job. If you're not, consider still spending more time on reading and thinking rather than defaulting to pitching in on a project deliverable if it isn't written in English prose (feel free to work on a project high level summary, objectives, and key results document).
