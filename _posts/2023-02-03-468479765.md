Imagine we want to compute the square root of a number n. The basic idea of [*Heron’s method*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_computing_square_roots#Heron's_method), named after the mathematician and engineer, Heron of Alexandria, is to find a number g that is close to n​ and to then average that with the number n/g, which corrects for the fact that g either over- or underestimates n​.
