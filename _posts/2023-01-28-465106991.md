For large-scale software *systems*, Van Roy believes we need to embrace a self-sufficient style of system design in which systems become self-configuring, healing, adapting, etc.. The system has components as first class entities (specified by closures), that can be manipulated through higher-order programming. Components communicate through message-passing. Named state and transactions support system configuration and maintenance. On top of this, the system itself should be designed as a set of interlocking feedback loops. Here Iâ€™m reminded of [systems thinking and causal loop diagrams](https://thesystemsthinker.com/guidelines-for-drawing-causal-loop-diagrams-2/).
