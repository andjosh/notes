Also another, related point is that as far as I can tell every decentralized crypto project has some central group of decision-makers who actually run the project, and then a veneer of decentralization. Shouldn’t the holders of Pollen tokens get to decide on its monetization strategy? Lol, no, absolutely not. Sure if they were *shareholders* of Pollen they’d have some legally binding governance rights. But they’re not.
