For the Integrity Institute, the label “integrity worker” applies to a broad swath of employees working on safety. Their [site](https://integrityinstitute.org/) reads, “If you have experience tackling any of these things on behalf of a social network, you’re probably an integrity worker.” They go on to list ethical design, hate speech, disinformation, toxicity, spam, and more than a dozen other areas.
