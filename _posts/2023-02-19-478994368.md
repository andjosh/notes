The unit of blogging isn’t pageviews, it’s conversations. Don’t worry about how many people will see it - sure you might post it in your feeds (why not) but the REAL MAGIC of the riff is deliberately sending it to people.

This idea is deeply internalized in riffs - so much that I typically write a riff with one specific person in mind.
