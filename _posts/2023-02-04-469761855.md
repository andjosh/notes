whenever folks talk about failed cultural change, I believe they’re stuck in one of two common traps:

1.  Their strategy for changing culture is to announce a new culture. Unfortunately, they soon recognize that announcing culture doesn’t work, you have to change the culture first, then you can further cement that change with an announcement
2.  They are earnestly trying to change culture, but their own actions and structure are getting in the way
