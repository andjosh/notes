Bigger projects often use a formal ‚Äúrequest for comments‚Äù (RFC) process to allow communities to discuss these changes before they are merged. In Python, for example, these requests are called Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs),68 while in Go, another programming language, a formal proposal is called a ‚Äúdesign document.‚Äù69 On smaller projects, the RFC process might just look like an informal discussion thread on an open pull request.
