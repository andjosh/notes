the questions my favourite writing professor would ask.

•   Do you actually have a point and have you made it?
•   Does your introduction present a compelling problem?
•   Are you assuming the audience is thicker than a brick?
•   Is this littered with passive voice (to be, is, was, were...) and evasive language?
