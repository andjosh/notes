Stereo width is a big part of the *Glowed Up* mix, with the 808 and synth chords being ultra-wide in the mix, and other sounds like the outro melody being completely mono. Using a mix of mono and stereoized sounds helps create a rich sounding mix, with every track having a space in the stereo spectrum.
