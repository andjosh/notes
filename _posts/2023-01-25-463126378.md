The **Queuing Rule of Thumb (QROT)** is a mathematical formula, known as the queuing constraint equation when it is used to find an approximation of servers required to service a [queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_area). The formula is written as an [inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inequality_(mathematics)) relating the number of servers (*s*), total number of service requestors (*N*), service time (*r*), and the maximum time to empty the queue (*T*):
