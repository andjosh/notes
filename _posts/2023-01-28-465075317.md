[Many years ago I got obsessed with habit-breaking days.](https://interconnected.org/home/2003/01/16/some_answers_to) We live our lives in self-reinforcing networks of habits: you walk down the street so you see the Pret coffee shop so you go in and you see the snack you always get and… BUT: walk down the *other* side of the street and your eye is caught by an old spot that you can only see from that angle which takes you to a place where you try something else and you sit in and do your emails before your commute so you get a seat on the train aaaaand… you’ve got a new routine.

What if you discovered a secret toggle, deep in the Settings of your phone, and it was labelled *“Routine”* – and one morning you tapped “Turn off until tomorrow.”
