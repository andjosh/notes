One publication well-known enough by cognoscenti to get namechecked in The Big Short (movie edition) is Grant’s Interest Rate Observer. It has cranked out two issues a month since 1983. Grant’s is both for historical and brand positioning reasons heavily tied up with the personal brand of Jim Grant, and is stubbornly independent.

This is notable because there are two natural sizes for publishing businesses: boutique and gigantic.
