•   **“Advancing the industry.”** I believe that I can improve practice in the technology industry. Examples: writing *good* blog posts, writing books that are read, supporting strong leaders in finding larger roles
•   **“Personal growth & practice.”** I am energized by doing new things and getting better at things I find meaningful. Examples: writing (even if it isn’t read by others), running further or lifting more weight, practicing the piano, programming more
•   **“Endurance for the long-run.”** I see many talented folks burn out on their work and hobbies. I want to continue doing both long-term, even if it means slowing down in the short-term. Examples: creating space to do less, rest, vacation, breaking routine
