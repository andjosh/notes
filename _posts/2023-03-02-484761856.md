Instead, the basic principle I would like to see communicated to people is the idea that every form of authority and domination and hierarchy, every authoritarian structure, has to prove that itâ€™s justifiedâ€”it has no prior justification. For instance, when you stop your five-year-old kid from trying to cross the street, thatâ€™s an authoritarian situation: itâ€™s got to be justified. Well, in that case, I think you can give a justification. But the burden of proof for any exercise of authority is always on the person exercising itâ€”invariably. And when you look, most of the time these authority structures have no justification: they have no moral justification, they have no justification in the interests of the person lower in the hierarchy, or in the interests of other people, or the environment, or the future, or the society, or anything elseâ€”theyâ€™re just there in order to preserve certain structures of power and domination, and the people at the top.
So I think that whenever you find situations of power, these questions should be askedâ€”and the person who claims the legitimacy of the authority always bears the burden of justifying it.
