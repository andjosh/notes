If only they were literally raping children and then eating their body parts, *then* everyone would have to admit they were bad. There would be an extremely specific, objectively bad thing you could point to, that would completely justify basically any level of antipathy to them! And so (the theory goes), people get busy looking for the evidence that they’re eating children.

For these conspiracies, maybe the evidence that people are trying to explain isn’t weird bullet trajectories or pyramid-related coincidences, it’s *their own emotions* . I don’t know if this is an overly clever way of putting it, or if it’s just literally true.
