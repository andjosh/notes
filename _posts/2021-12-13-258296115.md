In the lab or studio, the hardest question to answer is What shall we build? What shall we? The most energizing question for engineers usually comes after this shall bit. They want to rush to: How do we build it? Or even: What can we build with the stuff we’ve got? They want to minimize the talking and get to the build itself, wrangling with code or laser cutters or 3D printing.
