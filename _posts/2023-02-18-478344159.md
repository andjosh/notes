I’ve often seen teams leading reliability efforts respond to the question of why their incident analysis efforts aren’t creating more reliable software by doubling down on metadata collection and heavily structured processes. I think of this as *incident legalism*. Incident legalism is when an incident response and analysis program—trying to better drive reliability improvements—becomes focused on compliance and loses empathy for the engineers and teams operating within the program’s processes.
