Nothing is unimportant to a little child. He might cry if the wrong person peels an orange. On some level this makes sense: When your model of the world is paper thin, a tenuous thing that startles you endlessly, the few experiences that become routine carry a lot of weight. If someone else peels the orange then you might as well change the rules of gravity, too. This may be part of why they enjoy reading the same book over and over: knowing what is going to happen (in the story, or just on the next page) is some of the first mastery they can engage in, and there is always a satisfaction to mastery.
