Code runs on people. Please keep it simple.

"Everyone knows" that code is something you type into a computer, that gets interpreted by a computer, and is run by a computer. But that's not really the end of it. Before that, it's being "run" on whoever's working on it. After that, it's "running" on whoever's digging into it to fix a bug or add some feature.
