Interlace is “the device of interweaving of a number of different themes … all distinct and yet inseparable.” The device is thought to have originated with Ovid. Denis Feeny in his introduction to Ovid’s Metamorphoses, notes that the “haphazard chain of association is entertaining, but it also reinforces the Ovidian theme of the very contingency of connectedness.”
