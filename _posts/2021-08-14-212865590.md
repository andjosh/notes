Bryan Beckman is a Clearwater environmentalist whose daily life has been affected by the red tide. 

“I can usually feel it in my throat when I go outside one or two days before there’s any kind of announcement about it,” Beckman told the Florida Political Review. 

Beckman is chair of the executive committee for the Suncoast Chapter of the Sierra Club, a group that has been publicly raising awareness about the red tide and urging officials to do more to stop the outbreak.
