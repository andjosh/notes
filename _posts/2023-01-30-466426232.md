**Create capacity (rather than capture it).** This value focuses leaders on creating new capacity from outside the company, rather than fighting internally for existing capacity. Creating capacity makes [the first team mindset](https://lethain.com/first-team/) possible, because it aligns incentives across managers who would otherwise be competing with one another for budget. More discussion on this in [Create capacity rather than capture it](https://lethain.com/create-capacity/).
