An immediate hypothesis was that Omicron may have developed in a single immunocompromised human patient over a period of weeks or months[: ... y]ou don't just immediately kill everything off - you give the virus or bacterium a chance to overcome a lesser challenge before turning up the pressure a bit more, letting mutations accumulate and try their worth over and over as the challenge slowly increases. That's just what's going on inside a coronavirus patient if they can't mount a full immune response. The virus and the immune system engage in a prolonged battle where neither one can land a decisive blow, and things just keep on evolving. This is why they tell you to take your full course of antibiotics when you have a bacterial infection, and why effective vaccines actually suppress variant formation: if you kill off the pathogens as quickly as possible, they don't have time to explore their mutational landscape
