I call this “unlocking the commons,” and it’s the same approach I’ve taken with my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/tcarmody) and [newsletter](https://www.tinyletter.com/tcarmody). Fans support the person and the work. But it’s not a transaction, a fee for service. It’s a contribution that benefits everyone. Free-riders aren’t just welcome; free-riding is the *point*. This, I think, is key to understanding the psychology of patronage.
