I’m personally convinced that these companies are selling products that harm the companies that use them rather than help them. Using productivity metrics to measure individuals this way is akin to incident retrospects that identify human error as the root cause. It’s performative, and if you want to blame someone then just go ahead and blame someone, don’t waste your time getting arbitrary metrics to support it.

The real need here is capturing the data to support learning, and learning happens in batches. It’s useful to look at how the defect rate compares across teams, as long as you dig into understanding what those teams do differently.
