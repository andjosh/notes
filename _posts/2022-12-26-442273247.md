in the web, it makes sense that links should reflect *potential*, since you don’t know what people reading your document will want to follow. But in a personal database it makes a lot more sense that links should follow *usage*: they should be a crystallization of the trails you’ve followed, rather than an a-priori structure that you impose before usage.
