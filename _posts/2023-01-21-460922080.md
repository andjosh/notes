In contemporary Japan, however, as a general rule, all buildings must be detached. The 1919 Building Law established some required separation between buildings to prevent fire leaping from house to house, and the 1950 Building Standards Law expanded the rule to forbid buildings from touching each other in most cases. This shift resulted in the creation of countless tiny gap spaces between buildings in Tokyo's urban landscape. — *Emergent Tokyo* , p.166
