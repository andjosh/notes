Scenius” is Brian Eno’s term meaning *communal genius* and [last time I talked about it](https://interconnected.org/home/2020/08/18/filtered_for_small_groups) (2020) I quoted some of the essential qualities. Including: mutual appreciation (scenius as peer pressure) – or to put it another way, a healthy jealousy without envy – competitive collaboration!
