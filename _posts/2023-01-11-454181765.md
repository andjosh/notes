Many people believe that cash, the paper printed by the government, is coextensive with money, and that bank deposits kept at private sector banks represent a claim on money. Neither of these is true. Instead, bank deposits *are themselves* money, created by a public/private partnership. They are the *dominant form* of money. An economist would tell you about the [M1 versus M2 money suppl](https://pressbooks-dev.oer.hawaii.edu/principlesofeconomics/chapter/27-2-measuring-money-currency-m1-and-m2/)y here. As a sometimes product person in financial services, I’d just handwave and say “About 90% of what the entire world thinks of money is useful money and 10% is legacy paper certificates that banks will happily exchange for useful money.”
