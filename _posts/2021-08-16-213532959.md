It’s also silly when the moral terms of our engagement with other people are set for us by the discourse, whatever that is. And, I mean, on my less generous days, I go with it just like anyone else. The same as ordering a Lyft or ordering a hamburger because I don’t want to cook. The convenience of our moment recreated in not just our art but also our human discourse and human congress.
