As described in Rumelt’s [Good Strategy, Bad Strategy](https://www.amazon.com/Good-Strategy-Bad-Difference-Matters/dp/0307886239), a strategy is composed of three parts: circumstances, guiding principles, and concrete action. The best way to think of the relationship between values and a strategy (business, technology, or otherwise) is that useful values generally can serve as a strategy’s guiding principle. Not all guiding principles are values (e.g. how you respond to a current market opportunity is unlikely to be a value), but most values are viable guiding principles.
