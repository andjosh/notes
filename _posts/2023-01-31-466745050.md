The most important notation that summarizes a queue:

•   ρ: utilization ratio = λ / μ

Examples:

•   ρ = 1 means the arrival rate is equal to the service rate; the queue is staying the same size.
    
•   ρ > 1 means the arrival rate is greater than the service rate; the queue is getting larger.
    
•   ρ < 1 means the arrival rate is less than the service rate; the queue is getting smaller.
