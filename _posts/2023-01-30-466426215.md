**Default to vendors unless it’s our core competency.** You can also write this as: build versus buy decisions should consider the full implementation and maintenance costs. It is often more intellectually interesting to build commodity solutions than to use existing vendor solutions, but the cost of operating, maintaining and extending those solutions is often much higher. Good build versus buy decisions look beyond the initial implementation cost, and don’t prioritize initial fun over long-term maintenance pain.
