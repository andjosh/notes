This first lab newsletter of 2023 is very link-y, perhaps a bit raw. That feels like a good place to start, because my main objective this year is to be an “attention router”, brisk and functional, connecting you to some worthwhile inventions and provocations. And, with luck, contributing a few myself.
[[I like the concept of attention routing::rmn]]
