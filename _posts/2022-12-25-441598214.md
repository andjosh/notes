Ultimately, I decided not to, and developed the idea that I should identify the lessons I didnâ€™t want to learn from life, and simply choose not to learn them. My intent was not necessarily to evaluate whether a certain lesson was true or false in a given context, rather that there are certain lessons that are true in some scenarios, but learning them forms a limiting belief. Limiting belief, founded on a circumstantially true lesson, can change the slope of your future in unpleasant ways.
