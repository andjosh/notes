TDD/FP/Agile zealots are probably zealots because adopting TDD/FP/Agile/Whatever made them better programmers than they were before. If the choice is between them being zealots and them not learning the new techniques, it’s probably better for their company and their development that they’re zealots.
I mean it would be better if they learned TDD/FP/Agile/Whatever without becoming zealots, and incorporated their ideas into an overall synthesis of a nuanced programming philosophy, but I don’t think most people are interested in doing that anyway.
Possibly because “synthesizing a nuanced programming philosophy” only matters / is useful to a very small slice of programmers, because it’s honestly a kinda weird thing to expect tens of millions of people to be that weirdly obsessive about their job.
