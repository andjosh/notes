While today thereâ€™s a wide distance between GDPR, CCPA, HITRUST, FedRAMP and SOC2, I *generally* expect the gaps between these various frameworks to narrow significantly over time around the premise of all customer data being treated as sacred. Consequently, I expect the necessary controls to implement these frameworks to converge, such that the burden to an organization to comply across multiple compliance regimes will shrink. However, this convergence will occur in a haphazard series of jerky, unpredictable steps as various countries, states and regulators push towards stricter controls
