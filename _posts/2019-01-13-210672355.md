Consider Kim Berry, who runs the Programmers Guild, a nonprofit that lobbies Congress to limit or ban H-1B visas for talented computer programmers from overseas. He has said that for every person from India or China who gets a job programming in the United States, someone who was born here loses a job. It’s win/lose, in his view, not win/win.
It’s very difficult to be generous if you have this point of view. In a zero-sum game, the generous among us are fools, easily taken advantage of.
On the other hand, if you believe that great talent leads to more innovation and more productivity, which then lead to more demand, generosity is the very best strategy. If every great programmer were given the best tools, the best marketing, and the best technology, imagine how much more work that would create for the members of the Programmers Guild. If we enlarged the pie by bringing in the best programmers from around the world, it’s inevitable that tons of jobs would be created for local talent as well
