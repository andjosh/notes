The main issue here is that, at least when it comes to online platforms, journalists both believe that they are an identity and act like they’re a community, but also refuse to see themselves as an online subculture with its own specific and *subjective* point of view. Which they absolutely are. For instance, journalists need just as much custom moderation as furries, if not more. The difference is furries know they’re furries.
