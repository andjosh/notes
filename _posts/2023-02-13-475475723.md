So people are going to be even more blindsided when someone develops an AI that uses GPT as its language comprehension *component*, but does this higher level stuff that we *actually* want sitting on top of it. Because in my opinion, it's pretty clear that GPT is producing an *amazing* level of comprehension of what a series of words means. The problem is, that's *all* it is really doing.
