There’s a third impact of AI harder to spot and even harder to sell, but (and therefore) immensely more powerful: a change not in the tools but in the way the game is understood. Victories coming not from better technology but from a deeper, richer understanding of what’s going on. Deploying AIs guided by the strategic understanding of humans aided by dashboards is precisely the wrong way to look at both.

I’ve said this before, and it’s getting clearer by the week: you will know a competitor is qualitatively outthinking you not when you can’t replicate their products but when, even with the benefit of hindsight, you can’t replicate the thought process that led to them.
