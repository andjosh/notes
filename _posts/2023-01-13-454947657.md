**Designing for Disassembly** ensures that all elements of a product can be disassembled for repair and for [end of life](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/commodity.html). This allows for and encourages repairs, with the result that a product's life cycle is prolonged; and it allows for a product to be taken apart at the end of its life so that each component can be reclaimed. Among other shifts in thinking and making, this means minimizing materials, using simple mechanical fasteners instead of adhesives, clearly labeling components with their material type, and ensuring components can be disassembled with everyday tools.

Unlike the nebulous goal of designing a *sustainable* product, designing a product for disassembly is a more concrete, quantifiable approach to ecologically sound making and to consumption.
