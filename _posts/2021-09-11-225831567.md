A lot of developer tools also assume a developer will switch to an entirely new toolchain to get a relatively small set of benefits. For most software teams, this is a nonstarter.

Instead, we need to focus on more interoperability with existing dev tools, as well as on more incremental improvements (yes) that arenâ€™t a so-called paradigm shift but that actually work with what exists.
