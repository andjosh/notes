Luxury always boils down to time: someone is paying a lot of money for a lot of other people’s time. The question is, where do you invest that time? Rather than spending the bulk of it on line cooks fastidiously plating each dish, I’d want to put the time into the sourcing (growing or foraging) of incredible ingredients. Working on slow ridiculous fermentation projects. Gathering together the wisdom of plant-based culinary traditions with hundreds of years behind them. It still wouldn’t be revolutionary, but maybe it would be cool.
