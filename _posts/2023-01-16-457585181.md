In October of last year, YouTube creator and fandom expert Sarah Z coined the term “ [sacrificial trash](https://substack.com/redirect/76bb3cb9-f409-4fe2-b605-6e67a21b2164?j=eyJ1IjoiMXlmdTFqIn0.qYv5NVQwodvs9yAW1b9IqXxz-UTiPAUp4JXaRMXUArU) ,” and it’s a great concept. If I can try and condense her almost hour-long video into one sentence: “Sacrificial trash” is a piece of media that tries to pander to young audiences with woke identity politics to cover up how mediocre it is, which, in turn, creates a chaotic feedback loop of online discourse.
