[Noriaki Kano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noriaki_Kano), a Japanese researcher and consultant, published a paper in 1984[[1]](https://foldingburritos.com/blog/kano-model#fn1) with a set of ideas and techniques that help us determine our customers’ (and prospects’) satisfaction with product features. These ideas are commonly called the *Kano Model* and are based upon the following premises:

•   Customers’ **Satisfaction** with our product’s features depends on the **level of Functionality** that is provided (how much or how well they’re implemented);
•   **Features can be classified into four categories**;
•   You can **determine how customers feel about a feature through a questionnaire**.
[[Categories are: Attractive (high satisfaction and functionality, Performance (medium satisfaction and functionality), Must-Be (low satisfaction, high functionality, aka table-stakes), Indifferent (low satisfaction and functionality)::rmn]]
