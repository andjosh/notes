"**Cartesian theater**" is a derisive term coined by philosopher and cognitive scientist [Daniel Dennett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Dennett) to refer pointedly to a defining aspect of what he calls [Cartesian materialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_materialism), which he considers to be the often unacknowledged remnants of [Cartesian dualism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_dualism) in modern [materialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialism) theories of the [mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind).

> Cartesian materialism is the view that there is a crucial finish line or boundary somewhere in the brain, marking a place where the order of arrival equals the order of "presentation" in experience because *what happens there* is what you are conscious of. ... Many theorists would insist that they have explicitly rejected such an obviously bad idea. But ... the persuasive imagery of the Cartesian Theater keeps coming back to haunt us—laypeople and scientists alike—even after its ghostly dualism has been denounced and exorcized.
