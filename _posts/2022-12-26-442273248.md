"**Cartesian theater**" is a derisive term coined by philosopher and cognitive scientist [Daniel Dennett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Dennett) to refer pointedly to a defining aspect of what he calls [Cartesian materialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_materialism), which he considers to be the often unacknowledged remnants of [Cartesian dualism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_dualism) in modern [materialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialism) theories of the [mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind).
