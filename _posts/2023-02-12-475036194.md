As long as people think that government (as an ideal and an imperfect reality) is the enemy, we are doomed. Global warming and other problems are too complex to be solved without a collective action, rooted in a desire to make our lives better in ways that are not contingent on market efficiency or personal enrichment. Can a society be said to suffer from dementia? Watching my father succumb, I'm more convinced than ever that he is far from alone.
