And on Instagram, such narratives are presented in a curatorial whitespace that one associates most often with museums. And in that way, a careful tension emerges between performance and the real. It’s a tension I thought of when, over lunch, I discussed Flannery O’Connor’s idea of how symbols work in fiction. O’Connor describes a symbol as something that belongs to the material reality of a story even as it accumulates meaning as it participates in the story. And one of my new friends said that a pastor friend of his had said, “A symbol is a sign that participates in the reality that it signifies.” There it was. I wanted not just the beautiful furniture, but the life signified by the beautiful furniture.
