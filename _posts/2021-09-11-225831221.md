If our notion of “what is supposed to happen” is getting weaker, then developer experience becomes about helping developers and IT teams understand what their software systems are doing in the first place. We can’t see what is supposed to happen, so we need to see what IS happening. This means we need to shift from a mindset and approach of monitoring to a mindset and approach of observing — which in turn suggests that the future of developer experience hinges on better experience of observability.
