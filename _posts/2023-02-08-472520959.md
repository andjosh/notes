Programmable notes are note-taking systems that allow you to write programmatic rules that facilitate particular ways of working with your notes.

Based on triggers (specific conditions are met, input from the user, time of day), they kick off a sequence of actions. Actions might be prompts for the user to answer, transformations on the notes themselves, or requests to external websites and data sources for information.
