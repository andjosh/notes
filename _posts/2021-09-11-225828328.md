A general heuristic I’ve come to use to ascribe “value” to (a portion of) my life and work is that of: How many hours / weeks / months a year am I spending with people who truly inspire and delight and generate a mutually positive bump in ye old “good vibes” or excitement about life itself? How many symbiotic creative “partnerships” am I entering into? And am I at least maintaining / increasing that number of connections in meaningful ways as time passes?
