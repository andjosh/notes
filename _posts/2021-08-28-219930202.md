Monkeypatching Responsibly
I like to frame the monkeypatching conversation around responsibility instead of whether or not it’s good or bad. Sure, monkeypatching can cause chaos when done poorly. However, if done with some care and diligence, there’s no reason to avoid reaching for it when the situation warrants it.

Here’s the list of rules I try to follow:

Wrap the patch in a module with an obvious name and use Module#prepend to apply it
Make sure you’re patching the right thing
Limit the patch’s surface area
Give yourself escape hatches
Over-communicate
