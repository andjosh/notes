Jacqui Brown asked me what would have happened if, in 1990, the UAW had gone on strike against the auto companies.
What if, she wondered, the unions had gone on strike, not over wages or work rules but because the car companies werenâ€™t being innovative enough? What if they had walked out not over a contract dispute but because the industry refused to challenge the status quo and reinvent itself?
