Instead, it’s much better to wrap your patch in a module and apply it using Module#prepend. Doing so leaves you free to call the original implementation, and a quick call to Module#ancestors will show the patch in the inheritance hierarchy so it’s easier to find if things go wrong.

Finally, a simple prepend statement is easy to comment out if you need to disable the patch for some reason.
