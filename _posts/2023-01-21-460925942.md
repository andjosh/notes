**Accretive** tools build over time. Developer tools tend to work like this: platform-as-code. Wikis are the main one: [Notion](https://www.notion.so) is accretive. (I love Notion.) Pipeline-based tools like Trello fall on the accretive end, for me – memory resides in the tool, not the users. Accretive tools need gardening because they don’t forget by default.
