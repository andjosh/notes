**A few desirable qualities for creative contexts:** Note that very few have all these qualities to the level you desire. You kinda have to develop techniques for improving them:

• They will help drive you to completion, shipping some project you care about, and whose scale is commensurate with your emotional involvement;
• They supply both a very powerful *emotional* and an *intellectual* context;
• The are relatively *on demand* and *accessible* when you want; and
• They're ideally things you can revisit over and over and over again, gaining inspiration and motivation and drive for action.
[[These are like talismans that bring energy to your work.::rmn]]
