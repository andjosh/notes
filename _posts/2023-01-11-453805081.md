Modern generative models are generic data transformation engines, able to take one type of data (e.g, a script) and port it into another (e.g, a song, a poem). This is a deep and weird idea the more you think about it. What would you do if you can ‘transpose’ anything into anything else? RIFFUSION is a creative example of what happens when you play with this idea.
