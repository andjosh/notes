There are articles about how to drive like a real-world road warrior, how to prioritize your needs in an emergency, and how to stay alert when roaming the disaster area. But the most notable stories are the ones about how to scan the people around you for potential threats, and how to spot signs of human trafficking among your neighbors. I wonder if, in any of the other eleven issues, there is a single article about getting to know your neighbors, and building the structures of community and mutual support that are the true path to successfully managing through a real crisis, aggregating a diversity of individual skills.
