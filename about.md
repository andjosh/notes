I'm an experienced startup operator with a history of scaling tech and teams. I'm a self-taught software developer, (and tech lead, and manager) with a much wider-ranging career and education before that. I strive to bring curiosity, encouragement, and first-principles thinking to the work I'm doing.

I'm currently building as a Senior Staff Developer at Shopify.
